      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS will almost always follow a basic pattern like... Selector {

          property : Value ;

          }

          for a real example... h1 {

          color: purple ;

          }</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>The best way to incorporate CSS into HTML is w an External Stylesheet, you code all the CSS in its own
          document and then link it to your HTML. The link should be in the head of your HTML file after the last meta
          tag.</li>
        <li>RGB values on CSS range from 0 (off) to 255 (max). For example rgb (255,0,0) is max red while rgb (0,0,0)
          is black.</li>
        <li>Adjacent selector example. h1+p { color: red;} This selects only the paragraphs that are immediately
          preceded by an h1.</li>
        <li>Direct Child example div > li {color: white;} Selects only the li's that are direct children of a div
          element.</li>
        <li>Attribute selector example... input [type="text"] {width: 300 px; color: yellow;} selects all input
          elements where the type attribute is set to "text".</li>
        <li>Pseudo Classes are keywords which are added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected
          element(s). Examples are :active, :checked, :first, :first-child, :hover, :not(), :nth-child(),
          :nth-of-type(). Thet always start w a colon.</li>
        <li>Pseudo Elements are keywords added to a selector that lets you style a particular part of selected
          element(s). For example, ::after, ::before, ::first-letter, ::first-line, ::selection. generally you should
          use 2 colons but most browsers don't actually care, 1 can be used.</li>
        <li>The Cascade in CSS refers to the fact that the order your styles are declared in and linked to matters!
          For example h1 {color: red;} h1 {color: purple;} PURPLE WINS!</li>
        <li>Specificity is how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to the same
          element. The more specific selector wins! The general formula to specificity goes as follows. ID> CLASS>
          ELEMENT</li>
        <li>Border Properties: The most important ones are Border-Width, controls the thickness of the border.
          Border-Color, controls the color of the border. Boyder-Style, controls the line style - dashed, solid, etc.
        </li>
        <li>Border shorthand allows you to change the width, style, and color of a border all by typing border: width
          that you want, style that you want, color that you want.</li>
        <li>border-radius: Rounds the corners of an elements outer border edge.</li>
        <li>The shorthand for padding is just padding: example. padding: 10px applies 10px of padding to all four
          sides!</li>
        <li>EM's are relative units. With font-size, 1em equals the font-size of the parent. 2em's is twice the
          font-size of the parent, etc. With other properties, 1em is equal to the computed font-size of the element
          itself.</li>
        <li>REM's pr ROOT EM's are relative to the root html elements font-size. Often easier to work with. If the
          root font-size is 20px, 1 rem is always 20px, 2rem is always 40 px,etc.</li>
        <li>The a in rgba handles the opacity of whatever you are applying rgb on. It ranges from 0-1 with 0 being
          completely transparent & 1 not being transparent at all.</li>
      </ul>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
The motivation for completing this project was to give myself a general understanding of Web Development so I can put myself in a position to succeed in this bootcamp.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 
I built this project to use as a template to gather my notes and show my progress throughout the bootcamp.

- What problem does it solve? This Prework project solved the problem of going into the bootcamp blind, now I have a little bit of coding experience to help me hit the ground running.

- What did you learn?
I learned a lot, i would say the two main things that stuck out to me were learning how to use GitHub along with GitBash on windows to Push and Pull my progress as it went along. Also, learned how to write and call a function with JS, as well as how to add a variable, incorporate arrays and for loops and much more!
